    <p id="para" class="center"><em>It's hard to go wrong with spaghetti and meatballs. It's cheap, fast, and easy to make. Only problem is you may eat it to much. Spaghetti is typically made with spaghetti noodles, hence the name. You can replace the noodles with any one of you're choosing but I prefer the classic. You can also swap meatballs out with ground beef to make meat sauce, which is also great. Lucky for us either way the steps to make are the same!</em></p>
