    <p id="para"class="center"><em>This dish is my favorite as it's still super easy to make, may take slightly longer but is a big change in flavor if you like pasta and need something different. At it's simplest, Chicken Alfredo is a pasta dish made with a white alfredo sauce and chicken of course. You can also add other things as well to spice it up, such as garnishes, brocoli, and my favorite peas. To make this easy and friendly for everyone I've only listed steps to cook it plain as a lot of people dislike "greens" in their food.</em></p>
